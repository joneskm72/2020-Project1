Class project

We plan to create an application that allows users to search for dog breeds that fit their specific qualifications, wants, and needs. The application will allow users to select multiple criteria, then retrieve information/photos related to the breeds that appear in the results.
The website will have the following components:

-A homepage containing information about the purpose of the application

-A button that allows the user to get started

-A series of optional selections that appear after clicking on the start button

-A results page that contains photos of and details about the breeds that fit the users selections
